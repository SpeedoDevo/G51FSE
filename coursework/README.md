>This is a well written and nicely presented write up. The synopsis is clear but a bit brief. The requirements section is particularly detailed and well done, including the use of the linked requirements table. Similarly, the game design section is well written and aids with the understanding of the produced code. The object oriented decomposition description is excellent and at the right level of detail. However, UML could have been used more effectively to demonstrate the class details. You provide a lengthy testing report, but some of the tests have not been passed - this is not good practice as you should not really ‘release’ code which contains lots of bugs. The evaluation section is more of a reflection rather than a user evaluation, but provides some interesting insights.

>The quality of both the game and its code are excellent. The only comment we have for the game is that we felt that given the fact that you were free to do pretty much anything, that the game style chosen was a little tame and unengaging in terms of gameplay.
